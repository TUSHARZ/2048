Remember Flappy Bird? Neither do we. Because now we have 2048 and all else is a meaningless blur of non-slidey card viral gaming fun.

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game it was originally written in JavaScript and CSS during a weekend, as free and open-source software subject to the MIT license. 

The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
